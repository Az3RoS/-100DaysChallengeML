## Introduction
Everyone is going crazy these days, hearing the words Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Data Science. Well, it is certainly no Astrophysics with so many successful stories all around the web of people pursuing a career in this field. So why not dive into it a bit. It maybe vast, but what can happen. I mean, I won't drown right. Let's fill the apetite of our curious mind.

There are some wonderful articles, you can check for a better understanding of the subject. This one caught my eye though, hope it helps! [Why Machine Learning?](https://www.simplilearn.com/what-is-machine-learning-and-why-it-matters-article)


I am taking on the 100 Days of Machine Learning Coding as proposed by [Siraj Raval](https://github.com/llSourcell). I have to mention certain people who have been a great source of inspiration with their articles and some awsome inforgraphics - [Avik Jain](https://github.com/Avik-Jain/100-Days-Of-ML-Code) and [Harshit Ahluwalia](https://github.com/harshitahluwalia7895/100DaysOfMLCode).

So, let's start with a battle cry!

## Day - 0

Planning and collecting materials to begin with covered most of the day.  I have all set up and ready to roll.

## Day - 1

I came across this blog which explained the fundamentals of Python in a simple way. With some basic programming knowledge, it will be a stroll in the park. 

1. [Python 101: The Basics](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/python-101-the-basics-441136fb7cc3)

2. [Python 101: Data Structures](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/python-101-data-structures-a397bcc2bd30)

3. [Python 101: Object Oriented Programming part 1](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/python-101-object-oriented-programming-part-1-7d5d06833f26)

4. [Python 101: Object Oriented Programming part 2](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/python-101-object-oriented-programming-part-2-8e0db3ddd531)


This 4-Part series explains it clearly.
However, if you need in-depth knowledge of Python, here's another article you can refer - [Python in Depth](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-basics/)

There are some wonder functions in Python. I will make an article on it soon.

## Day - 2

I ventured a bit into the intermediate and advanced areas of python. As python covers a huge span, I had to take each step carefully else there was a probability of getting lost in its vastness. These are some articles which might help you as well.
1. [Python Step-by-Step](https://www.techbeamers.com/python-tutorial-step-by-step/)
2. [Python Beginner 2 Advanced](https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-tutorials-home/)

Hope you are enjoying the things so far. There are some topics you might want to focus a bit more - List comprehensions and Lambda Expressions. They will come in handy while you move to the Advanced level.

## Day - 3

Linear Algebra is a key foundation to the field of machine learning, from notations used to describe the operation of algorithms to the implementation of algorithms in code. The concepts of Linear Algebra are crucial for understanding the theory behind Machine Learning, especially for Deep Learning. They give you better intuition for how algorithms really work under the hood, which enables you to make better decisions.

So let's start with the basics -
1. [Basics of Linear Algebra 1](https://towardsdatascience.com/linear-algebra-for-deep-learning-f21d7e7d7f23)
2. [Basics of Linear Algebra 2](https://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/linear_algebra.html)

This will give you a brief idea of the concepts. Once you get an overview of the things, let us quickly jump into the things we are going to need for our course.
1. [Linear Algebra Review using Python](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs231a/section/section1.pdf)
2. [Linear Algebra for Machine Learning](https://machinelearningmastery.com/linear-algebra-cheat-sheet-for-machine-learning/)

Please bookmark this [Cheatsheet](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/Python_SciPy_Cheat_Sheet_Linear_Algebra.pdf). It will help you through tough days of remembering formulas.

Alternatively, if you want to deep dive into the concepts of Linear Algebra, you can refer the following -
* [Linear Algebra and Its Applications -  A book by David Lay](http://www.r-5.org/files/books/computers/algo-list/linear-algebra/David_Lay-Linear_Algebra_and_Its_Applications-EN.pdf)
* [Khan Academy Linear Algebra](http://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/algebra-matrices)
* [Immersive Math](http://immersivemath.com/ila/index.html)

These are few notable tutorials among other good ones.
