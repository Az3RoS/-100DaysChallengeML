## Introduction
Everyone is going crazy these days, hearing the words Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Data Science. Well, it is certainly no Astrophysics with so many successful stories all around the web of people pursuing a career in this field. So why not dive into it a bit. It maybe vast, but what can happen. I mean, I won't drown right. Let's fill the apetite of our curious mind.

There are some wonderful articles, you can check for a better understanding of the subject. This one caught my eye though, hope it helps! [Why Machine Learning?](https://www.simplilearn.com/what-is-machine-learning-and-why-it-matters-article)


I am taking on the 100 Days of Machine Learning Coding as proposed by [Siraj Raval](https://github.com/llSourcell). I have to mention certain people who have been a great source of inspiration with their articles and some awsome inforgraphics - [Avik Jain](https://github.com/Avik-Jain/100-Days-Of-ML-Code) and [Harshit Ahluwalia](https://github.com/harshitahluwalia7895/100DaysOfMLCode).

So, let's start with a battle cry!

## Day - 0

Planning and collecting materials to begin with covered most of the day.  I have all set up and ready to roll.

## Day - 1

I came across this blog which explained the fundamentals of Python in a simple way. With some basic programming knowledge, you will just cruise through. 

1.[Python 101: The Basics](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/python-101-the-basics-441136fb7cc3)

2.[Python 101: Data Structures](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/python-101-data-structures-a397bcc2bd30)

3.[Python 101: Object Oriented Programming part 1](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/python-101-object-oriented-programming-part-1-7d5d06833f26)

4.[Python 101: Object Oriented Programming part 2](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/python-101-object-oriented-programming-part-2-8e0db3ddd531)


This 4-Part series explains it clearly.
However, if you need in-depth knowledge of Python, here's another article you can refer.[In-Depth](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-basics/)

There are some wonder functions in Python. I will make an article on it soon.

## Day - 2
