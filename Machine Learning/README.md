# Machine Learning

Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed. 

**_"The ability to learn"_** - for a machine, seems pretty intersting, huh!

Let’s try to understand Machine Learning in layman terms. Consider you are trying to toss a paper to a dustbin.
After first attempt, you realize that you have put too much force in it. After second attempt, you realize you are closer to target but you need to increase your throw angle. What is happening here is basically after every throw we are learning something and improving the end result. We are programmed to learn from our experience.
This implies that the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms.

Within the field of data analytics, machine learning is used to devise complex models and algorithms that allow researchers, data scientists, engineers, and analysts to “produce reliable, repeatable decisions and results” and uncover “hidden insights” through learning from historical relationships and trends in the data set(input).

### Basic Difference in ML and Traditional Programming?

* **Traditional Programming :** We feed in DATA (Input) + PROGRAM (logic), run it on machine and get output.
* **Machine Learning :** We feed in DATA(Input) + Output, run it on machine during training and the machine creates its own program(logic), which can be evaluated while testing.

Now, you might be wondering whether Data science, analytics, and machine learning are all the same. Well there have their own way of doing things but to simply draw a line between them, let us look at the infographic.
